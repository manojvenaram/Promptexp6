# Experiment 6: Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

## Aim:
To compare the responses of two open-source language models, GPT-Neo and GPT-2, to a given question, and analyze how different models generate text and handle natural language queries.


## Procedure:

### 1. Install Required Libraries:
Install the necessary Python libraries using the command below:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### 2. Load Models:
Load two pre-trained language models from Hugging Face:
- **GPT-Neo**: `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B`
- **GPT-2**: `gpt2`

### 3. Define Functions:
Define two functions to generate text from both models:
- **GPT-Neo Function**: Generates text from the GPT-Neo model.
- **GPT-2 Function**: Generates text from the GPT-2 model.

### 4. Generate Answers:
Input the question "What are the benefits of renewable energy?" to both models and generate their responses.

### 5. Compare Answers:
Compare the generated answers from both models to see if they match or differ.
- Print the responses and a summary indicating whether the answers are the same or different.

### 6. Execute the Code:
Run the code to generate and compare answers.


## Deliverables:
1. **Python Script**: A script to compare answers from two models.
2. **Comparison Output**: The answers generated by both models and a summary of whether the answers are similar or different.

## Sample Code:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load GPT-Neo and GPT-2 models
generator_neo = pipeline('text-generation', model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B')
generator_gpt2 = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Function to get answer from GPT-Neo
def get_gpt_neo_answer(question):
    generated_text = generator_neo(question, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    return generated_text[0]['generated_text']

# Function to get answer from GPT-2
def get_gpt2_answer(question):
    generated_text = generator_gpt2(question, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
    return generated_text[0]['generated_text']

# Function to compare answers from both models
def compare_answers(question):
    answer_gpt_neo = get_gpt_neo_answer(question)
    answer_gpt2 = get_gpt2_answer(question)

    print("GPT-Neo Answer:", answer_gpt_neo)
    print("GPT-2 Answer:", answer_gpt2)

    if answer_gpt_neo == answer_gpt2:
        summary = "Both models provided the same answer."
    else:
        summary = "The answers are different."

    print("Summary:", summary)

    return {
        "question": question,
        "gpt_neo_answer": answer_gpt_neo,
        "gpt2_answer": answer_gpt2,
        "summary": summary
    }

# Run the comparison with a sample question
question = "What are the benefits of renewable energy?"
result = compare_answers(question)
print("Comparison Result:", result)
```


## Result:

### Input Question:
"What are the benefits of renewable energy?"

### GPT-Neo Answer:
```
What are the benefits of renewable energy? The first thing to do is to ask the question what are the benefits of renewable energy? In this article I will show you what are the benefits of renewable energy. We will analyze the three main benefits of renewables: Lower costs – There are many reasons for which people want to reduce their energy costs, and here renewable energy has a considerable advantage. – There are many reasons for which people want to reduce their energy costs.
```

### GPT-2 Answer:
```
What are the benefits of renewable energy? Are the climate problems a real problem or can we start addressing the problem by switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energies? We can do both, and we all make the best decision that matters. Some studies say we can solve global oil supply problems in Europe, while others say we can solve global climate problems in Asia. We can make a difference in the environment. There are a few reasons to support renewable energy. For one, we...
```

### Summary:
The answers are different.

## Conclusion:

The experiment successfully demonstrates the integration of multiple AI tools using Python. By querying both GPT-Neo and GPT-2 models via the Hugging Face library, the script automates the task of generating responses and analyzing their content. The comparison of responses revealed distinct differences in style and approach, with GPT-Neo providing a more structured and technical response, while GPT-2 adopted a conversational and broader perspective. This indicates that both AI models process the query uniquely, reflecting their respective architectures and training data.
